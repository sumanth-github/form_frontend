    { "question": "Does it contain any added sugar?", "answer": "No, 100% natural almonds only." },

### **Reflection**

During development, AI tools were used to dynamically generate context-aware follow-up questions for each product. This ensures that users provide complete, relevant details without manually creating long forms for each category.

Architectural principles focused on **modularity**, **separation of concerns**, and **scalability**. The frontend communicates with a dedicated AI backend service, keeping AI logic separate from UI rendering. Product transparency logic was guided by **user-centered design**, ensuring clarity, accountability, and completeness of product information.
